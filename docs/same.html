“Then I ought to have said ‘That's what the <i>song</i> is called’?”  Alice
corrected herself. “No, you oughtn’t: that's quite another thing! The
<i>song</i> is called <i>‘Ways And Means’</i>: but that’s only what it’s
<i>called</i>, you know!”
</p>

<p>
“Well, what <i>is</i> the song, then?” said Alice, who was by this time
completely bewildered. “I was coming to that,” the Knight said. “The
song really is <i>‘A-sitting On A Gate’</i>: and the tune’s my own
invention.”

<p>
<span class="newthought">Maybe it’s just me</span>
but I feel that concepts in programming languages ought to mean
something and that the documentation for those languages ought to
explain what they mean. In this regard, Python and I do not get along.
</p>

<p>
Take the concept of an <i>object</i>. The <i>Python Language Reference</i><label for="fn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
All of the quotes are from <i>The Python Language Reference</i>, section 3,
“Data model”, subsection 3.1, “Objects, values and types”.</span> has this
to say about objects:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Objects</i> are Python's abstraction for data. All data in a Python
program is represented by objects or by relations between objects. (In
a sense [&#x2026;] code is also represented by objects.)
<footer> <i>The Python Language Reference</i> </footer>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So objects sound pretty fundamental.<label for="fn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> I am not clear what is meant
by “relations between objects.” I think the most likely interpretation
is “references,” in the sense that, in a running program, most objects
will contain references to other objects and this structure is part of
what constitutes the data in the program.</span> And yet the subsequent
explanation is to my mind wholly unedifying.
</p>

<p>
I’ve noticed two kinds of reactions when I talk about this. People who
actually know computer science tell me that I should read chapter 18
of Pierce<label for="fn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> <i>Types and Programming Languages</i>, Benjamin
C. Pierce. Chapter 18 is “Case Study: Imperative Objects,” and chapter
32 is, “Case Study: Purely Functional Objects.”</span> or maybe even all of
Abadi and Cardelli<label for="fn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> <i>A Theory of Objects</i>, Martin Abadi and Luca
Cardelli.</span> Those people are right! I should read those things. I
<i>will</i> read those things, probably, right after I am done being
annoyed at the <i>Python Language Reference</i>, and then I will come back
here and write about them.
</p>

<p>
People who use Python, on the other hand, say, it’s just an object,
you know? You call methods on them, they're great, you don’t have to
know what’s going on inside. I explain to those people that it’s
<i>important</i> to know what’s going on inside, and then they look at
their watches and say things like, well, I really must be getting back
to <i>writing actual, useful code</i> in <i>the most popular programming
language in the world</i>, and frankly that is just unfair.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, what I’d like to do here is attempt to say just what I find
unsatisfying in the <i>Language Reference</i>. I’m not sure why. Maybe so
you will find it unsatisfying too?
</p>

<p>
Here’s what the <i>Reference</i> goes on to say about objects:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Every object has an identity, a type and a value.
<footer> <i>The Python Language Reference</i> </footer>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It sure would have been nice to read a definition at this point! This
is more like the sort of thing you write just after a definition. But,
okay, it’s close. One could imagine that what is meant is something
like, “Every object has an identity, a type and a value <i>and nothing
else</i>.”  Perhaps what was meant is that there are no further facts
about an object <i>other than</i> its identity, type, and value. If that’s
the right interpretation then, in order to understand objects, it
would suffice to understand these three components. And the
<i>Reference</i> does indeed go on to talk about types, values, and
identities.
</p>

<p>
About identity, the <i>Reference</i> has this to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
An object’s <i>identity</i> never changes once it has been created; you may
think of it as the object’s address in memory. The <code>is</code> operator
compares the identity of two objects; the <code>id()</code> function returns an
integer representing its identity.
<footer> <i>The Python Language Reference</i> </footer>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Look, I am going to have to digress to complain about the italics. I
realise I am going to sound old and curmudgeonly but in my defence I
sounded old and curmudgeonly when I was young, too. The thing is,
there <i>is</i> a good reason for “identity” to be in italics. It is common
practice in technical writing to italicise a new term when it is first
introduced and, indeed, this is the first time we’ve come across
“identity,” apart from the previous quote. But also it is <i>good</i>
practice to make sure that the introduction actually tells you what
the term <i>means</i>. Or at least gives you sufficient information to make
a decent guess. This isn’t that! What this is, is some fact <i>about</i>
identity. Is it the only fact? Is it the defining fact? I don’t know!
</p>

<p>
It’s as if I had said, “Examples of animals are cats, dogs, and
arklethropes. An <i>arklethrope</i> is never more than one metre high.”
That doesn’t tell me what an arklethrope is! All I’ve learned is that
it’s neither a cat, nor a dog; and that if what I have is more than
one metre high then I haven’t got an arklethrope. No reason to put
that in italics: I am just as confused about arklethropes as before.
</p>

<p>
It’s possible, I supppose, that the <i>Reference</i> assumes that the
reader already has a view of identity as a concept and that it is this
idea that is intended. But I am not sure that I, for one, do have a
clear idea of what identity means. The <i>Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy</i> has quite a long <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity/">article on identity</a> and so it’s clearly
not a trivial topic.
</p>

<p>
What we do know, at any rate, is that if you have an object at one
time, and the very same object at another time, then their
“identities” will be the same. (Presumably either the value or the
type might be different.)
</p>

<p>
It’s not clear how to get <i>hold</i> of an identity. We’re allowed to
“think of” it as the object’s address in memory&#x2014;but that doesn’t
mean that’s what it is. If that’s what it was, we wouldn’t have to
think of it that way, that’s just what it would be. It might happen to
the address in memory in some implementation but not in
another. Still, one might imagine that you get hold of the identity,
in whatever form the implementation uses, with <code>id()</code>; but in fact
what that gives you is “an integer <i>representing</i> the identity”
(emphasis added); again, presumably that is not the same as the
identity itself otherwise the <i>Reference</i> would have said so. 
</p>

<p>
Crucially, however, it <i>is</i> apparently possible to check whether two
objects have the same identity. The operator <code>is</code> does this. (I guess
that it returns <code>True</code> if the objects have the same identity and
<code>False</code> otherwise.)
</p>

<p>
I’m not convinced that the following makes any sense but perhaps the
reason that you can’t get hold of an identity and must, instead, rely
on the <code>is</code> operator, is that it’s unclear what kind of thing it would
be if you did get hold of it. For example, what if it were an obect?
(After all, the <i>Reference</i> does say that everything is an object.)
Well, suppose you had two objects and were wondering whether they were
the same object. The way to do that&#x2014;I guess?&#x2014;would be to see
whether they have the same identity. So you obtain their identities
and ask, are these the same identity? But how do you answer <i>that</i>
question? If the identities are objects, then you are supposed to
obtain <i>their</i> identities and ask are these the same object? There is
an infinite regress.
</p>

<p>
I’m going to assume that identities are not a thing-in-the-language:
it doesn’t make sense to ask what they are. Sure, in CPython you can
get hold of an integer “representing” the identity by using <code>id()</code>&#x2014;but
you probably shouldn’t. What you can say, in Python, is just whether
two objects are <i>the very same</i> object or not.
</p>

<p>
The Reference talks about types next but I am going to skip ahead to
the point where it discusses values and return to types shortly.
</p>

<p>
I think I know roughly what values are in other languages. I think of
values as elements of sets. For example 3&#x2014;the number three&#x2014;is that
element of the set of natural numbers. In functional languages, it is
values&#x2014;not objects&#x2014;that are the fundamental tokens of
computation. Two values are the same just in case they are the same
value. Values do not change: if they did change, they would be a
different value. Values are referentially transparent: One 3 is just
as good as another 3. If I replace 3 in this part of my program with
“another” 3 nothing is, or can be, observed to be different.
</p>

<p>
With that context, here’s the <i>Reference</i> on values:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The <i>value</i> of some objects can change.
<footer> <i>The Python Language Reference</i> </footer>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Again, this is not a definition! At best it is additional
information. It’s not like we get a definition, either: this is
basically all that is said about values. (There’s a further paragraph
about which objects’ values can change and which can’t but I don’t
think it sheds any light on what values <i>are</i>.)
</p>

<p>
If an object “has” a value, what <i>is</i> that value? Just as with
identity, there doesn’t seem to be any way to get hold of a “bare”
value. Consider <code>3</code>&#x2014;I mean the thing you get when Python reads
“~3~”. That’s not a value, it’s an object. Look, it has a type and
everything:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #6c71c4;">print</span>(<span style="color: #6c71c4;">type</span>(3))
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
&lt;class 'int'&gt;
</pre>


<p>
Presumably the value of the object denoted <code>3</code> is the value 3? There
seems to be no way so far to understand what that means.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Reference</i> tells us that the value of some objects can
change. (Presumably the object <code>3</code> is not one of those objects!) In
other words, the same object can at one time “have” one value and at
another time “have” a different value.<label for="fn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label><input type="checkbox" id="fn-5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote"> The alternative reading is
that the object “has” the same value but the <i>value</i> has
changed. However, I’m pretty sure that the entire point of values is
that they don’t suffer from the same philosophical problems of
identity as objects: values just are.</span> Can you tell? Probably not!
First of all, we haven’t yet been given any way to decide whether the
values of two objects are the same value. Even if we were, there is a
deeper problem, which is that you can’t compare an object at one time
t<sub>1</sub> with the same object at some later time t<sub>2</sub> because by the time
you get to t<sub>2</sub> you no longer “have” the object at t<sub>1</sub>. You could
(perhaps) make a <i>copy</i> at t<sub>1</sub> and, at t<sub>2</sub>, compare the copy with the
original. But then you would be comparing <i>different</i> objects at t<sub>2</sub>.
</p>

<p>
So far, we can tell whether two objects are the same object (or
not). They have values but it’s unclear what that means. What about
types? The <i>Reference</i> says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
An object’s type determines the operations that the object supports
(e.g., “does it have a length?”) and also defines the possible values
for objects of that type. The <code>type()</code> function returns an object’s
type (which is an object itself). Like its identity, an object’s type
is also unchangeable. [1]
<footer> <i>The Python Language Reference</i> (footnote in original)</footer> 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Look, my mental model of Python is, or at least was up to now, that a
Python program is a sequence of statements and control-flow
structures, and that statements are essentially class or method
definitions, assignments, or method calls. This being an
object-oriented language you’d think method calls would be the single
most important construct. Where are they in the <i>Reference</i>? They’re
in chapter 6, <i>Expressions</i>, section 6.3, <i>Primaries</i>, subsection
6.3.4, <i>Calls</i>. Okay!
</p>

<p>
I guess the object that is the type of an object has something to say
about the available method calls: those being the “operations that the
object supports.”
</p>

<p>
The footnote is in the original. It reads:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is possible in some cases to change an object’s type, under certain
controlled conditions. It generally isn’t a good idea though, since it
can lead to some very strange behaviour if it is handled incorrectly.
<footer> <i>The Python Language Reference</i> </footer>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I don’t know what this means? Apparently the type of an object is
<i>not</i> unchangeable? At least, not always?
</p>

<p>
I &#x2026; give up. Having written all the above I’m no longer sure what it
is that I am trying to understand. What I’d like, I suppose, is a
coherent model of Python objects which is consistent with the reality
of Python implementations. Reading the <i>Reference</i> did not help! I
think I am left with either reading some other document or thinking
harder.
